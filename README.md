# Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning

## Overview
This document outlines the steps taken to preprocess data for a machine learning project. The preprocessing steps include handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, splitting the dataset into training and test sets, and applying feature scaling.

## Project Structure
- `Data.csv`: The dataset used for preprocessing.
- `data_preprocessing.py`: The script containing the data preprocessing steps.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn


##Usage
To run the preprocessing script, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Pawankumar1432/CodeTech-Task1.git

2)Ensure Data.csv is in the project directory.

3)Run the preprocessing script:

 python data_preprocessing.py



##Data Preprocessing Steps

o Getting the dataset

o Importing libraries

o Importing datasets

o Finding Missing Data

o Encoding Categorical Data

o Splitting dataset into training and test set

o Feature scaling



##Conclusion
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning project. By following the steps outlined above, you can ensure that your data is clean, well-prepared, and ready for model training and evaluation.
